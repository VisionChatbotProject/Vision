      \   s mistakes and being able to correct them"
  utter_tree_model:
  - text: "The tree model provides a guide to planning an effective learning and teaching\
      \ experience  Both the teacher side as well as the learner side are represented\
      \ and considered in the tree model  The tree model is divided into 4 categories\
      \  roots  growth  blossoming  and renewal"
  utter_situated_learning:
  - text: "Humans are socially curious beings and learn mainly through social interaction\
      \ with others  Therefore  a learning environment should promote cooperation\
      \  discussions and group work and provide opportunities for feedback"
  utter_social_participation:
  - text: "Groupwork  social interaction in the learning environment as well as collaborative\
      \ work related to studying and learning foster social participation  Providing\
      \ students with opportunities to give receive feedback and express their opinion\
      \ also supports social participation"

      \ resources and strategies  learners are encouraged to actively participate\
      \ in the learning process"
  utter_Maria_Montessori_approach:
  - text: "Maria Montessori   s approach is based on the idea that children are naturally\
      \ eager for knowledge and capable of learning and by creating positive learning\
      \ environments with well-designed teaching materials  the desire to learn is\
      \ enhanced"
  utter_focus_of_Maria_Montessori_approach:
  - text: "The focus of the Montessori approach lies in a combination of the psychological\
      \  emotional and intellectual development of a child"
  utter_cooperative_learning:
  - text: "Cooperative learning is a pedagogical practice that promotes children s\
      \ socialization and learning by working together to complete tasks"
  utter_behaviorism:
  - text: "In behaviorism  students learn through reinforcement  constant positive\
      \ or negative feedback from their teacher tells them what they are doing is\
      \ either right or wrong"
  utter_learning_theories:
  - text: "Learning theories describe the way knowledge is taught and learned  The\
      \ thus developed models determine the application of teachers  instructional\
      \ designs  The most relevant learning theories are constructivism  behaviorism\
      \  cognitivism  connectivism and subject-orientation"
  utter_constructivism:
  - text: "The emphasis in constructivism is on providing students with experiences\
      \ that should help them develop their own knowledge  This knowledge is linked\
      \ to each learner s lifeworld  The teacher takes on the role of a learning companion\
      \ who provides the necessary space for self-directed learning  Learning thus\
      \ becomes a collaborative process where teachers and students develop knowledge\
      \ together"
  utter_problem_based_learning:
  - text: "Problem-based learning lets students work on real-life problems with the\
      \ goal of identifying possible solutions to the problem  This way"
  utter_subject_oriented:
  - text: "The term  subject-oriented  refers to forms of teaching that provide learners\
      \ with the possibilities to lead learning activities and shape their own learning\
      \ progress  The subject-oriented understanding of learning defines learning\
      \ as personal development process that is based on individual reasons for learning\
      \ rather than outside forces  Therefore  instead of viewing learning as an activity\
      \ that occurs when someone is being taught  subject-oriented learning argues\
      \ that learning only takes place when the subject  the student  has a reason\
      \ to learn  Learners are thus intrinsically motivated"
  utter_premack_principle:
  - text: "The Premack principle states that students are more willing to participate\
      \ in an activity they do not enjoy if they know that an activity they enjoy\
      \ will follow"
  utter_teacher_centered:
  - text: "Teacher-centered refers to learning situations where the teacher guides\
      \ the learning process  He she has control over what and how students learn\
      \  The teacher takes on the active part by presenting knowledge"
  utter_difference_between_teacher_centered_and_subject_based:
  - text: "In the teacher-centred approach  learners are extrinsically motivated because\
      \ they have no say in their learning process  Also  learners who are not as\
      \ fast in grasping concepts are more likely to miss and or misunderstand information\
      \  As a result  their individual abilities are given less consideration since\
      \ attention is primarily paid to what learners cannot do"
  utter_think_pair_share:
  - text: "The think-pair-share method gives all students the opportunity to interact\
      \ with other students and takes the pressure off of students who may have difficulty\
      \ engaging in class"
  utter_microsystem:
  - text: "The Microsystem is the most immediate environment in which children live\
      \  The Microsystem includes the home  school or daycare  the child s peer group\
      \ and his her community  In the Microsystem  the child interacts with family\
      \ members  classmates  teachers and caregivers"
  utter_Bronfenbrenner_theory:
  - text: "In his Ecological Systems Theory  Bronfenbrenner introduces the concept\
      \ of multiple environments in correlation to child development  It consists\
      \ of layers  namely the Microsystem  home  school  family  classmates   the\
      \ Mesosystem  relationships between microsystems   the Exosystem  external factors\
      \ such as the educational or political system  and the Macrosystem  values \
      \ beliefs and norms   Teachers can only directly influence the learning environment\
      \ at school  but by providing enough positive learning experiences  they can\
      \ help counteract negative experiences the student may have had in other parts\
      \ of their microsystem"
  utter_socialization:
  - text: "Socialization is the process in which the individual develops relationships\
      \ with other individuals and adopts certain behaviors towards them  Socialization\
      \ is important for a successful social participation in the teaching learning\
      \ setting"
  utter_meaningful_activities:
  - text: "An activity is considered meaningful in the teaching learning context when\
      \ the learner views it as useful or beneficial to their individual learning\
      \ process  This promotes intrinsic motivation"
  utter_learning_new_information:
  - text: "Successful learning is only possible when new information can be connected\
      \ to previously acquired knowledge and by activating said knowledge"
  utter_direct_instruction:
  - text: "Nowadays  direct instruction is considered insufficient for contemporary\
      \ learning needs because learners are mainly passive and do not actively engage\
      \ with the learning content  Nevertheless  it can  at times  prove to be a useful\
      \ teaching strategy when introducing new content  Methods of direct teaching\
      \ are  for example  the lecture  didatic questioning or the demonstration"
  utter_interactive_instruction:
  - text: "In interactive instruction  students learn from both their peers and their\
      \ teacher through discussion and sharing  Methods of interactive instruction\
      \ are  for example  discussions  debates  brainstorming  All these methods enable\
      \ multi-perspective learning"
  utter_support_student:
  - text: "Active involvement in the learning process helps learners to internalize\
      \ what they have learned  This can be promoted by involving students in the\
      \ learning process and in the design of the lessons  The students can determine\
      \ part of the learning content themselves and learning goals can be formulated\
      \ together"
  utter_large_group_teaching:
  - text: "The larger the class  the more difficult it is for teachers to respond\
      \ to the individual needs of each student"
  utter_experiential_learning:
  - text: "Experiential learning states that students learn best when they are directly\
      \ engaged or in touch with the material being studied  in other words  when\
      \ they experience the knowledge first hand rather than just reading  hearing\
      \ or talking about it  This type of learning is very subject-oriented and action-oriented\
      \ which allows creating a direct link between theory and practice"
  utter_simulation:
  - text: "Students are presented with an artificial problem or situation based on\
      \ reality and put into a simulated environment  Play and reality are essentially\
      \ combined to encourage communication and promote critical thinking"

  - text: "Students research topics and present their results in the form of a report\
      \  a presentation  an artwork or in another creative way"
